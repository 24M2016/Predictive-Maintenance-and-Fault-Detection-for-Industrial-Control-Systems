# ðŸ”§ Predictive Maintenance & Fault Detection for Industrial Control Systems

This project implements a machine learning-based system for predictive maintenance and fault detection in industrial environments (e.g., manufacturing, robotics, power systems). It integrates with control systems and includes a Java-based app for real-time monitoring.

---

## Features

- Predict equipment failures using ML (supervised & unsupervised)
- Time-series analysis with sensor data (vibration, temperature, pressure)
- Control system feedback to optimize operation
- Java-based GUI/API (Spring Boot, JavaFX)
- Dockerized deployment for scalability
